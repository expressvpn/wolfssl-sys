== Reporting a vulnerability

ExpressVPN takes the security of its applications and services seriously.
We encourage you to submit any security-related issues to our bug bounty
program.

=== How to Submit a Report

Researchers should submit their reports through
https://bugcrowd.com/expressvpn[Bugcrowd]. Alternatively, we also accept
submissions by email to security@expressvpn.com.

*Please note:* ExpressVPN uses Bugcrowd to manage all bug bounty programs.
Submitting via email means that we will share your email address and share
content with Bugcrowd for the purposes of triage, even if you arenâ€™t a member
of the platform.
